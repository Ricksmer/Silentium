# Silentium

Silentium is a dark fantasy adventure set in a world plunged into eternal silence—no voices, no songs, not even the whisper of wind. Humanity drifts in a bleak, lifeless existence until a mysterious bell rings across the land, awakening shadowy monsters born from the fear of this silence.

Players follow children born during this silent era, each wielding a unique instrument, as they journey through ruined cities and desolate lands to uncover the truth behind the silence, the bell, and an unknown godlike entity responsible for the world’s plight.

In this hauntingly atmospheric game, music becomes both weapon and hope—only by playing instruments can the children weaken the encroaching shadows and restore sound to the world. With no spoken dialogue, the story unfolds through narration and personal monologues, creating an immersive, eerie experience where every choice shapes a unique ending.

Will these Children of Silence bring back the world’s lost voice, or will darkness claim the last note?
